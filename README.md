# macOS Theme 4 Windows
This Repo Contains All The Tools You will Need To Make Your Windows 11 or 10 device look like Apple's operating system for computers known as Macs or Macbooks.
## Disclaimer
I am in NO way Aficiallated With Apple And Neither are the tools listed in this repo.

ALSO, If This in someway breaks your computer, dont blame me. it clearly your fault!

# Step 1/ The easiest step yet
Right, so you obviously opened this repo to make your windows device look like a mac. so what you want to do is to download The zip File in the releases Tab.

After that You Want to Buy myDockFinder From Steam or you can sail the seven seas or some shit like piracy (illegal so i aint giving you scumbags a direct link).

# Step 2
Get 7zip or WinRAR from their respective links:

7zip: https://www.7-zip.org/

WinRAR: https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0

Now You Want to Locate the Recently Downloaded zip File i mentioned earlier (Step 1) and unzip it with either of these tools.
(You can use microsofts shitty BUILT IN zip extracter but 7zip or winRAR are better)
